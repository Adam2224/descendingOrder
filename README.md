The Code

The program starts off by asking the user to input the variables firstNember, secondNumber, and thirdNumber. 
An is statement is used for the first possibility that the first number entered is greater than the second number, which is greater than the third. A print stastement is included in the next line. The other possible orderes are accounted for using elif statements. Elif statements allow the programmer to check if multiple statements are true and executes when the conditions are met. A print statement is located under each elif statement. The print statements will tell the user their numhbers in descending order.
